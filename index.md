# Research and Projects

### 🎹 Generating MIDI Piano Performance with Transformers  
*Summer 2025*  
As part of a university lab project under the Computer Vision Chair, I am currently working on generating MIDI piano performances conditioned on MIDI input. We use REMI tokenization and train  **Mistral** models on the MAESTRO dataset. Our focus now lies in benchmarking our results against a recent **Llama**-based model with a custom embedding function and attention block called **Moonbeam**. The project involves hands-on experimentation with model architectures, tokenizers, embedding functions and evaluation metrics.

### 🐍 Mamba State-space Model  
*Summer 2024*  
Over the past summer at my home university, I participated in a research seminar the Machine Learning and Reasoning chair involving **Mamba**, a recent state-space model. The experience sparked my interest in continuing to explore state-space models on music data! Since Mamba-variants can process extremely long sequences more efficiently than Transformers, it can be interesting to see how they handle long temporal dependencies in music data.

### 🎵 Computer-generated Music  
During my bachelor degree at RWTH Aachen University, I did a seminar on computer-generated music, where I covered recent neural-network-based approaches like Google Magenta or the Bachbot, also discussing the **LZ** compression algorithm within the OpenMusic software. Ever since then, I have been following new research papers on computer-generated music.

### 🧠 Thesis at Institute for Computational and Systems Neuroscience  
*October 2022 – May 2023*  
I gained experience on hyper-parameter optimization during my bachelor’s thesis at the research institute in Jülich: The goal here was to find out whether an optimizee from the computational neuroscience domain can be embedded into **Optuna**, a framework originally designed for optimizing the hyper-parameters of machine learning models. This work involved extensive parallel computations on the JURECA cluster.

### 🚙 Practical at Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab  
*October 2021 – February 2022*  
Implemented trajectory planning and collision avoidance for model vehicles. Organized workflow in team of six with Scrum and Git.

# Work Experience

### Tutor at Research Group for Programming Languages and Verification  
*October 2021 – March 2022, October 2022 – March 2023*  
Gave weekly classes to group of students (~15) in lecture hall, evaluated coding assignments and exams and helped with questions. Tutored students in Software Development (Java), Functional Programming (Haskell), Logic Programming (Prolog) and Verification.

### Internship at BWI GmbH  
*March 2020*  
Received an overview on project management and project organization (Scrum). Was introduced to current JIRA-projects at the company.
