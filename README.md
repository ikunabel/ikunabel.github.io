# Research and Projects

### 🎹 Real-Time Human-AI Cooperative Jamming  
*Fall 2025*  
Currently pursuing my master’s thesis at the Chair for **Artificial Intelligence Methodology** at RWTH Aachen. Developing a real-time system where a human musician cooperates with an AI agent on a MIDI instrument (e.g., Yamaha Disklavier). Inspired by projects like jam_bot and ReaLchords, this system generates harmonies or melodies interactively.

### 🎹 Generating MIDI Piano Performance with Transformers  
*Summer 2025*  
**Paper accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on AI for Music.**  
Worked on generating MIDI piano performances with Transformers, comparing datasets, architectures, model sizes, and training strategies. Our 950M-parameter model trained on 80K MIDI files produces outputs often rated as human-composed.

### 🐍 Mamba State-space Model  
*Summer 2024*  
Research seminar on **Mamba** state-space models for music data. Explored long-sequence processing capabilities for temporal music dependencies.

### 🎵 Computer-generated Music  
Seminar on neural-network-based music generation (Google Magenta, Bachbot), including LZ compression in **OpenMusic** software.

### 🧠 Thesis at Institute for Computational and Systems Neuroscience  
*Oct 2022 – May 2023*  
Bachelor’s thesis on hyperparameter optimization with **Optuna**, parallelized on **JURECA** cluster.

### 🚙 Practical at Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab  
*Oct 2021 – Feb 2022*  
Trajectory planning and collision avoidance for model vehicles using Scrum and Git.
